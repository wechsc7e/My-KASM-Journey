-----------------

When following the instructions for installing KASM, it is very important to create the swap image for stability before going any further,
even going above and beyond by making the swap image 2 GiB if your server can handle it:

$sudo dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=2048 of=/mnt/2GiB.swap
$sudo chmod 600 /mnt/2GiB.swap
$sudo mkswap /mnt/2GiB.swap
$sudo swapon /mnt/2GiB.swap
$echo '/mnt/2GiB.swap swap swap defaults 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

Reverse Proxy
--------------
To reach my end-to-end encryption goal, it was important to run the web application on port 8443 to keep 443 open to my reverse proxy.
After following the instructions to download and unzip the KASM files, use the following command to install and listen on port 8443:

$sudo bash kasm_release/install.sh -L 8443

This will allow for port forwarding with NGINX proxy manager, which we will install on its own server later.

------------------

Once the installation is complete, you can access your web interface at https://<serverip>:8443

You will notice that the SSL certificate is being shown as invalid since the KASM installation uses a self signed certificate.
This doesn't mean that your traffic is unencryped but it is insecure by nature and can be open to Man in the Middle attacks so
we'll fix this with Let's Encrypt and NGINX Proxy manager
