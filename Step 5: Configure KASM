Ok, almost done here.  Go ahead and login to your KASM instance and you should be on the Admin page.  As a reminder, my goal here was to create a 
secure connection to use Hack the Box while totally isolated from my home network.  To do this, we will be enabling the Kali Linux image and
configuring it to work with the OpenVPN connection to the Hack the Box machines.  The problem with this is that KASM running Kali instances
in a Docker container doesn't play well with OpenVPN and the settings need some tweaking as I'm about to show you.

First step is to enable the Kali Linux image in KASM as it is turned off by default.  On the left side of your admin page, click on "Images"

Scroll through the pages until you find Kali and then click on the 3 dots at the end to find the "Edit" command

Click on the check box for "Enabled"

Under the "Docker Run Config Override (JSON)" section, add the following code:
------------
{
    "hostname":"kasm",
    "user":"root",
    "privileged" : true,
    "devices":
        [
            "/dev/input/event0:/dev/input/event0:rwm",
            "/dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun:rwm"
        ]
}
-----------
This code auto starts the Kali instance as a root, privileged user, and creates the tun0 interface required for OpenVPN to work and
communicate with Hack the Box

In the "Docker Exec Config (JSON)" section, add the following code:
-----------
{"first_launch":{"cmd":"bash -c 'sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0'","user":"root"}}
-----------
This tells KASM to enable IPv6 which is needed to run OpenVPN

NOTE: After you enter all the code and enable the instance, you will see a little warning triangle on the Kali box in the Workspaces area
until KASM finishes downloading the image file and this could take a while depending on your server

At this point, you should now be able to download the OpenVPN file from hack the box and run it on your Kali instance

That's it, you're done now!
