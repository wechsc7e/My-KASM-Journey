------------------------------
Configure SSL for Whole Domain
------------------------------
To configure NPM with all the changes and subdomains we created, first you will click "Add New Proxy Host"

When the dialog box comes up, type in the name of your domain (example.com) as the domain name and check the box for "Block Common Exploits"
Use the "https" scheme and input your KASM servers IP address and use Port 443. Make sure it is available to the public with the last option box.

Don't mess with "Custom Locations"

For the SSL tab, use the dropdown to select "Request a New SSL Certificate" and check off the boxes for "Force SSL" and "HTTP2 Support"

Click save and give it a minute to use Let's Encrypt to issue an SSL certificate for the domain.  This will cover your entire domain (example.com) at
this point and any pages you create on your web server will be encrypted under SSL and NPM will handle auto newing the certificate.

------------------------
Securing NPM Admin Page
------------------------
At this point, your whole domain (example.com) running on your KASM server is secured.  The last thing we have to do is secure your admin page
for NPM.

We will again "Add New Proxy Host"

Type in the domain "proxy.example.com"

Select "Block Custom Exploits" again

The difference this time is that we will use the "http" scheme and use the IP address for the server you put NPM on. Use port 81 this time.

Don't mess with any other tabs, we don't need another SSL certificate for this, save the record.

You will now have a proxy server for "example.com" and "proxy.example.com"

You have the option of using "kasm.example.com:8443" or "example.com:8443" to access the secure version of your KASM instance and you can use
"proxy.example.com" to directly access your NPM admin panel.

And you're done
