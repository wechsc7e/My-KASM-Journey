This one can be a little tricky, as it is installed as a Docker container which means you have to install Docker on your server first.

-----------------
To Install Docker
-----------------
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-22-04

This is the best tutorial I can offer you to walk you through the Docker Installation. Once you have Docker installed per the tutorial,
you will also want to install the Docker Compose Plugin to compile the .yml setup files for tou NPM installation:

$sudo apt-get update
$sudo apt-get install docker-compose-plugin

Verify Installation and Version
$docker compose version

At this point I highly advise you to take a snapshot of your server before moving onto installing NPM

------------------------------
To Install NGINX Proxy Manager
------------------------------
https://www.vultr.com/docs/how-to-install-nginx-proxy-manager-on-ubuntu-20-04-18428/

This is also the best tutorial that I can offer you and it walks you through the installation of SQLlite3 which is a prerequisite
for installing NPM and stores its data.

Again, I highly advise you take a snapshot of your current server state once everything is set up and stable.

Don't forget to change the default user name and password!
