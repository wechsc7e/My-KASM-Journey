Starting from zero experience, except a lifetime of using and tinkering with computers, I want to change careers from 911 Operator to Cyber Security Specialist. 
For my first project, I wanted to set up a secure, SSL encypted from end-to-end, KASM server to use as my Hack the Box station to use with their machines / labs..
To do this, I used Linode to set up two servers, one to run NGINX Proxy Manger and another to host my production KASM instance.
It took a while, with the help of YouTube and online forums, to navigate the challenges in making this happen and my hope is to make it easier on someone else.

See attached files and explanations to show how each should be applied and installation steps. Please use common sense in securing your servers before
using anything in a production environment (ex. Run Update/Upgrade in package manager to make sure all is up to date, etc...)

Please also note that in order to obtain a valid SSL certificate through NGINX Proxy Manager, you must own a domain name and have access to the DNS
Management options to create the appropriate "A" records allowing for proper forwarding. I personally used GoDaddy to purchase my domain name but
I transferred the nameservers to be managed through Cloudflare which is free to use and pretty straightforawrd.
