For my first project, I wanted to set up a secure, SSL encypted from end-to-end, KASM server to use as my Hack the Box station to use with their machines / labs..
To do this, I used Linode to set up two servers, one to run NGINX Proxy Manger and another to host my production KASM instance.
It took a while, with the help of YouTube and online forums, to navigate the challenges in making this happen and my hope is to make it easier on someone else.

See attached files and explanations to show how each should be applied and installation steps. Please use common sense in securing your servers before
using anything in a production environment (ex. Run Update/Upgrade in package manager to make sure all is up to date, etc...)

Please also note that in order to obtain a valid SSL certificate through NGINX Proxy Manager, you must own a domain name and have access to the DNS
Management options to create the appropriate "A" records allowing for proper forwarding. I personally used GoDaddy to purchase my domain name but
I transferred the nameservers to be managed through Cloudflare which is free to use and pretty straightforawrd.

Note on Linode Servers used:
-----------------------------
For KASM to run properly, I purchased a shared CPU VM with 4 GB of RAM and 80 GiB of storage since KASM requires at least 50 GiB of storage
costwise, this will set you back about $20 a month, with and additional $5 for optional backup which I highly advise you get. This backup
allows you to create snapshots of your server along the way as you reach stable checkpoints. Trust me, you will mess up and have to revert
back to a previous snapshot, I did it plenty.  I run Ubuntu 22.04 LTS on both servers and the commands I show you will reflect that.

For the 2nd server, for NGINX Proxy Manager, I opted for a scaled down shared CPU VM with 2 GiB of RAM and 50 Gib of storage for $10 a month 
but you can most likely get away with less.

If you do decide to use Linode, you can try it with a $100 credit for 60 days to see if you like it so this project will pretty much cost you nothing
for 2 months of use which is pretty nice.


******DISCLAIMER******
I don't have a lot of experience with this and I might not have set everything up perfect so I can't beheld responsible for any damage 
done to your servers while following my instructions.  With that being said, I am open to any comments or suggestions from anyone to improve 
upon the process or setups I describe.
